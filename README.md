CS:GO Autoexec.cfg file

###Usage:
Place autoconfig.cfg in Steam Install Directory/steamapps/common/"Counter-Strike Global Offensive"/csgo/cfg/

It will automatically be loaded on match start.

###Other Info:
An autoconfig.cfg does not violate cheating standards, and passes VAC. However, some professional 
rulesets have regulations on acceptable bindings. I hear that a frowned upon binding is +crouch on the mousewheel (but I may be wrong). 

###Hints:
Many people use +jump for mouse wheel up and down in order to make BHopping easier. 
I forego this binding for weapon switching because I can't Bhop for the life of me.
